## What RuOk Does üöÄ
Ru-Ok is a comprehensive mental health application that empowers users to navigate their emotional landscape through detailed emotion tracking, 
AI-powered support, and personalized wellness tools designed to transform emotional awareness into lasting wellbeing.

## Problem  üéØ
Many individuals face significant barriers in managing their emotional wellbeing:

- **Limited Emotional Vocabulary** - People struggle to articulate their feelings beyond basic terms, lacking the precise language needed to identify complex emotional states
- **Oversimplified Tracking Tools** - Traditional mood tracking apps reduce complex emotions to generic categories like "happy" or "sad," failing to capture the nuanced reality of human feelings
- **Lack of Actionable Support** - Most apps collect emotional data but provide minimal guidance on how to actually address or manage different emotional states
- **Minimal Access to Timely Resources** - Mental health support is often expensive, unavailable, or requires long wait times, leaving people without immediate help when needed
- **Gap Between Feeling and Understanding** - Users can sense something is wrong but can't pinpoint exactly what they're experiencing, creating confusion and frustration
- **Barriers to Effective Self-Care** - Without proper emotional identification and support tools, individuals struggle to develop healthy coping mechanisms and emotional regulation strategies
